# Mental-Imagery
Mental images and photographic memory are created in the mind as dendrite libraries created from visual input recognition. Series of visual electronic signals sent from the eyes to the optic nerve, Chiasma and Optic tract are recorded as dendrite libraries.

Mental images are created from stimulation of the Optic tract and Chiasma area using electrical patterns stored in dendrite libraries.
